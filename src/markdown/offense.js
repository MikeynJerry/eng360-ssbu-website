  `# Offense
  
A major point of appeal of the Super Smash Brothers series is the ferocity of gameplay that players can achieve. Smash Brothers is not like a typical fighting game where the goal is to drop the opponent's health to zero. A player wins a game of Smash Brothers by knocking their opponent off of the stage. Stringing together attacks and movements strategically can enable a player to gain the upper hand and knock their opponent off the stage!`,
  `## Damage Percentage

As mentioned previously, the goal is to knock your opponent off of the stage. Landing hits on opponents does not decrease their health, instead it adds a percentage of damage to them. The higher a percentage an opponent has, the further your attacks will launch them into the air. Eventually it becomes very easy to send your opponent flying, be careful the same does not happen to you!`,
  `## Comboing

A chain of attacks repeatedly beating down an opponent all the while leaving no opportunity of escape in sight is called a combo. Combos are difficult to pull off and vary on the fighter you have chosen. There are many combos that can be pulled off and players often find their own combos that they find that they can do with great effect. The ability to land a hit and follow it up with subsequent blows is a great way to rack up damage on an opponent and get them launched off the stage!`,
  `## Punishing

Sometimes an opponent makes a mistake, or does an action that leaves them vulnerable for a hit. Taking advantage of an opponent's mistake is called a punish. Routinely punishing opponents paves the way to an easy victory. One example of a punish is when the opponent shields often, punish this by grabbing the opponent or breaking the shield for a stun. Another example for punishment would be when your opponent dodge rolls through you, by predicting this movement you can punish the rolling opponent by attacking the direction they roll toward while they are in the middle of their roll.`,
  `## Pressure One: Juggling 

After damaging your opponent a bit, many attacks will send them flying. While your opponent falls back to the stage slowly they are incredibly vulnerable! Attacking them while they drift down with jump attacks from below will send them back into the air or flying off the stage! This process is called juggling: throwing your opponent into the air and preventing them from touching the ground. This pressure is a great way of controlling the pace of the game.
`,
  `## Pressure Two: Edge Guarding

  Sometimes an opponent will get launched off the side of the stage but are able to maneuver their way back on it. If the opponent is really good and making their way back to the stage, jump after them and try to attack them before they can make their way back to the ledge! Wedging yourself between the opponent and the ledge they need to get to is called edge guarding. Attacking them when their focus is shifted away from you leaves them defenseless. This technique may seem dangerous but it will get much easier with practice and is a sure fire way to become a Smash Brothers pro!`
